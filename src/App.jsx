    <p class="text-gray-700">
      I am a passionate software developer and entrepreneur with a keen interest in crafting efficient and innovative solutions to complex problems.
      My journey in the realm of coding began as a young boy with writing programs for my own entertainment.
      Besides my interest in computers i always had a strong pull towards entrepreneurship, i started multiple companies with variying levels of success.
      My latest company deepc, based here in munich, has grown to around 60 people with over 2 Mio. â‚¬ in ARR.
      My commitment to staying abreast of the latest industry trends and technologies ensures that my work is not only cutting-edge
      but also aligns seamlessly with the ever-evolving landscape of software development and tech management.
      In addition to my technical skills, I understand the importance of effective communication in translating complex technical concepts into layman's terms.
      Articulating ideas and concepts clearly and concisely, fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment and motivating my peers and students will help
      me to not only transfer knowledge, but spark the entrepreneurial spirit in a dynamic environments where innovation brings a sense of joy and accomplishment.
